  <h2 class="no-num no-toc" id=abstract>Abstract</h2>

  <p>This specification evolves HTML and its related APIs to ease the
   authoring of Web-based applications. Additions include the context menus,
   a direct-mode graphics canvas, inline popup windows, and server-sent
   events. Heavy emphasis is placed on keeping the language backwards
   compatible with existing legacy user agents and on keeping user agents
   backwards compatible with existing legacy documents.

  <h2 class="no-num no-toc" id=status>Status of this document</h2>

  <p><strong>This is a work in progress!</strong> This document is changing
   on a daily if not hourly basis in response to comments and as a general
   part of its development process. Comments are very welcome, please send
   them to <a href="mailto:whatwg@whatwg.org">whatwg@whatwg.org</a>. Thank
   you.

  <p>The current focus is in developing a first draft proposal.

  <p>Implementors should be aware that this specification is not stable.
   <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the discussions are likely
   to find the specification changing out from under them in incompatible
   ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this specification
   before it eventually reaches the call for implementations should join the
   <a href="/mailing-list">WHATWG mailing list</a> and take part in the
   discussions.

  <p>This specification is also being produced by the <a
   href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg">W3C HTML WG</a>. The two specifications
   are identical from the table of contents onwards.

  <h2 id=introduction><span class=secno>1. </span>Introduction</h2>

  <h3 id=background><span class=secno>1.1 </span>Background</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  <h3 id=scope><span class=secno>1.2 </span>Scope</h3>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  <h3 id=relationships><span class=secno>1.3 </span>Relationships to other
   specifications</h3>

  <h4 id=relationship><span class=secno>1.3.1 </span>Relationship to HTML5</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  <h4 id=relationship0><span class=secno>1.3.2 </span>Relationship to
   ECMAScript</h4>

  <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  <h3 id=conformance><span class=secno>1.4 </span>Conformance requirements</h3>

  <p>All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are
   non-normative, as are all sections explicitly marked non-normative.
   Everything else in this specification is normative.

  <p>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", <!--"SHALL", "SHALL
  NOT",-->
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the
   normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC2119. For readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
   letters in this specification. <a href="#refsRFC2119">[RFC2119]</a></p>
  <!-- XXX but they should be
  marked up -->

  <p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
   "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these
   steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("must",
   "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.

  <p>Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on attributes,
   methods or objects. Such requirements are to be interpreted as
   requirements on user agents.

  <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
   implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
   particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to
   be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)

  <p>The only conformance class defined by this specification is user agents.

  <p>User agents may impose implementation-specific limits on otherwise
   unconstrained inputs, e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard
   against running out of memory, or to work around platform-specific
   limitations.

  <h4 id=dependencies><span class=secno>1.4.1 </span>Dependencies</h4>

  <p>This specification relies on several other underlying specifications.

  <dl>
   <dt>HTML5

   <dd>
    <p>Many fundamental concepts from HTML5 are used by this specification.
     <a href="#refsHTML5">[HTML5]</a></p>

   <dt>ECMAScript

   <dd>
    <p>This specification is intended to be used with JavaScript as the
     scripting language. <a href="#refsJS">[JS]</a></p>

   <dt>WebIDL

   <dd>
    <p>The IDL blocks in this specification use the semantics of the WebIDL
     specification. <a href="#refsWebIDL">[WebIDL]</a></p>
  </dl>

  <h3 id=terminology><span class=secno>1.5 </span>Terminology</h3>

  <p>For simplicity, terms such as <em>shown</em>, <em>displayed</em>, and
   <em>visible</em> might sometimes be used when referring to the way a
   document is rendered to the user. These terms are not meant to imply a
   visual medium; they must be considered to apply to other media in
   equivalent ways.

  <p>The construction "a <code>Foo</code> object", where <code>Foo</code> is
   actually an interface, is sometimes used instead of the more accurate "an
   object implementing the interface <code>Foo</code>".

  <p>The term DOM is used to refer to the API set made available to scripts
   in Web applications, and does not necessarily imply the existence of an
   actual <code>Document</code> object or of any other <code>Node</code>
   objects as defined in the DOM Core specifications. <a
   href="#refsDOM3CORE">[DOM3CORE]</a>

  <p>A DOM attribute is said to be <em>getting</em> when its value is being
   retrieved (e.g. by author script), and is said to be <em>setting</em> when
   a new value is assigned to it.

  <p>If a DOM object is said to be <dfn id=live>live</dfn>, then that means
   that any attributes returning that object must always return the same
   object (not a new object each time), and the attributes and methods on
   that object must operate on the actual underlying data, not a snapshot of
   the data.
